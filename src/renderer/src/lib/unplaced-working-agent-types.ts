/**
 * Agent types a title must not claim permission for: exactly one fresh `working` row of that type
 * is filed under a tab this renderer does not have, which is what a pane re-keyed on restore
 * leaves behind. The live pane then has no row of its own, so its title is the only evidence left
 * — and the leftover `!` marker it was launched with contradicts the row that does report work.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, because yielding a permission title can hide a real question:
 * - only the type that has such a row yields, so another agent's dialog in the same worktree still
 *   needs input;
 * - two candidates of one type are ambiguous (either pane could own the title), so neither yields;
 * - callers must drop entries with orchestration context — a dispatch worker reports before its tab
 *   exists by design, and that absence says nothing about a re-keyed pane.
